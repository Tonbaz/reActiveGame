**# Game made with React Native.**  <br/>
**## This is my first React Native project that i have 100% myself. No tutorials, no copied code, pretty cool starter project!**  <br/>

**## Game idea:**  <br/>
    - Three rows of block tracks on screen  <br/>
    - Idea is to be quick enough to touch the falling block along the track  <br/>
    - Blocks are random size, and move at random speed along random track.  <br/>
    - If block falls all the way down to bottom of your screen, you lose after 3 blocks.  <br/>
    - Gain more points as you proceed successfully through the game!  <br/>
