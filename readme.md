Game made with React Native. 
This is my first React Native project that i have 100% myself. No tutorials, no copied code, pretty cool starter project!

Game idea: 
    - Three rows of block tracks on screen
    - Idea is to be quick enough to touch the falling block along the track
    - Blocks are random size, and move at random speed along random track.
    - If block falls all the way down to bottom of your screen, you lose after 3 blocks.
    - Gain more points as you proceed successfully through the game!
